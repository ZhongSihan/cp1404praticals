# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I've started breaking down each practical into smaller steps and committing my work regularly with clear messages. 
This has helped me understand the structure of my code and made it easier to debug and track progress. 
I also spend more time reading instructions before coding.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still need to manage my time better and avoid rushing close to deadlines.
Sometimes I underestimate how long a prac will take, especially if it involves testing or refactoring.
I plan to start each prac earlier and stick to a consistent work schedule.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I’m consistent with completing the practicals each week and I'm improving my understanding of classes and object-oriented programming.
I also try to understand the feedback and apply it in the next task. 
Reviewing others’ pull requests has helped reinforce good coding practices.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop copying or rushing through instructions without fully understanding the purpose of each task. 
I also want to stop ignoring version control early in the prac—committing often is something I still forget sometimes.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

It would be helpful if we had more examples or walkthroughs of more complex concepts like inheritance or APIs before the pracs.
Even short videos explaining the weekly key ideas would help reinforce the lectures and make the practicals feel less overwhelming.
