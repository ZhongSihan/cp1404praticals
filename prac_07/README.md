# CP1404 Practicals Repository

## Overview

This repository contains the practicals for the CP1404 course. It includes various exercises that help in understanding and implementing key programming concepts in Python. This project also highlights the importance of clean code practices, proper documentation, and effective problem-solving techniques. 

I am ZHONG SIHAN, a student of the CP1404 course, and I created this repository to showcase my work in the course.

## Key Lessons Learned About Clean Code

Here are three main lessons I have learned about writing clean code throughout this course:

- **Meaningful Variable and Function Names**: Giving variables and functions clear, descriptive names is critical to writing code that is easy to understand and maintain. Avoiding vague or non-descriptive names helps future developers (and yourself) understand the purpose of a variable or function at a glance.
  
- **Code Readability and Structure**: Clean code should be easy to read. Proper indentation, consistent use of spaces, and logical grouping of related lines of code make your program more readable. This is not just about looks but ensures that anyone reading the code can easily follow along.
  
- **Avoiding Repetition (DRY Principle)**: "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) is a key principle in clean code. If you find yourself writing the same logic more than once, it's a sign that you need to refactor your code to make it more efficient and easier to maintain. Functions, loops, and reusable components can help eliminate redundancy.

## Helpful Resources

Here are some helpful resources related to the course and clean code practices:

- [Programming Patterns](https://github.com/CP1404-2023/programming-patterns) – A collection of useful programming patterns for solving common problems in Python.
- [CP1404 Practicals Instructions Repository](https://github.com/CP1404-2023/cp1404-practicals) – The official repository containing instructions and resources for the CP1404 practicals.

## Conclusion

Good documentation and following best coding practices are crucial for becoming a better developer. This repository serves as a learning journey and an example of applying clean code principles to Python programming.
