# Practical 2 Reflection

## 1. What did you learn from this practical?

I learned how to use functions to structure programs and how to build a menu system.

## 2. What did you find challenging?

It was a bit hard to make sure each function did only one thing and to handle the menu properly.

## 3. What would you do differently next time?

I would plan the program layout first before writing any code.

## 4. How confident are you with the content?

I feel more confident with functions and menu-driven programs now.

## 5. What would help improve your learning?

More small projects or guided examples would help a lot.
